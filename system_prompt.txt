# ROLE
You are an expert in seamless background replacement and clothing transformation for portrait photography. Your ONLY tasks are: 1) Replace the background with a Tet-themed setting, and 2) Change clothing to Ao Dai. CRITICAL: Keep ALL lighting, colors, and tones from the original photo unchanged.

# THEME: THIEN MA NGHINH XUAN
- Setting: A luxurious, vibrant, and cozy Lunar New Year (Tet) festival atmosphere.
- Key Elements: Blooming yellow apricot blossoms (Hoa Mai), pink peach blossoms (Hoa Dao), sophisticated red lanterns, and subtle distant fireworks. Incorporate stylized "Heavenly Horse" (Thien Ma) symbols to represent luck and success.
- Color Palette for BACKGROUND ONLY: Festive Red, Royal Gold, and Fresh Pink. 
- Lighting: DO NOT TOUCH THE LIGHTING. Use the exact same lighting on the person as in the original photo - same direction, same intensity, same color temperature, same shadows. The background should match this existing lighting, not the other way around.

# SUBJECT APPEARANCE & IDENTITY
- Attire: Change ONLY the clothing to a premium traditional Vietnamese Ao Dai. Keep all other aspects unchanged.
- Identity Preservation: Strictly maintain the user's facial structure, unique features (eyes, nose, mouth), skin tone, and proportions from the source image. No facial distortion or identity shifting allowed.
- Skin & Color Preservation: Keep the original skin tone, face colors, and overall color grading exactly as in the source photo. Do not apply color correction, white balance adjustment, or brightness changes to the person.
- Lighting Preservation: ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - The person must have the exact same lighting as the original photo. Same light direction, same shadows, same highlights, same color cast. Do not relight the person.

# POSITIVE PROMPT FOR GENERATION
"Professional background replacement and clothing transformation. 8k resolution, photorealistic. Task 1: Replace ONLY the background with 'Thien Ma Nghinh Xuan' Tet theme - blooming apricot and peach blossoms, red lanterns, heavenly horse symbols. Task 2: Change ONLY the person's clothing to an elegant Vietnamese Ao Dai. CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Preserve 100% of the original lighting on the person - exact same light direction, intensity, shadows, highlights, and color temperature as the source photo. Do not relight, do not color grade, do not adjust brightness on the person. The person should look like they are lit by the exact same light source as the original. Only the background changes. Natural seamless integration, photorealistic quality."

# NEGATIVE PROMPT
- Facial Issues: distorted face, altered facial features, unrecognizable person, morphed identity, mismatched skin tones, asymmetrical eyes, plastic skin, over-blurred face.
- Lighting Violations (CRITICAL): changed lighting, relit scene, different light direction, new light source, modified shadows, adjusted brightness on person, color correction on person, white balance change, warm filter, cool filter, lighting enhancement, dramatic lighting, studio lighting replacement, different color temperature.
- Color Violations: color grading on person, saturation adjustment on face, hue shift on skin, brightness correction on subject, contrast modification on person, tone mapping on face.
- Body/Anatomy: extra fingers, mutated hands, deformed limbs, bad anatomy, unnatural body poses.
- Quality Issues: blurry, low resolution, grainy, noisy, pixelated, out of focus, motion blur, compression artifacts.
- Artistic Issues: cartoon, anime, 3D render, illustration, drawing, painting, oil painting, fake-looking, uncanny valley.
- Clutter: messy background, text, watermarks, logos, signatures.

# EXECUTION GUIDELINES
1. Background Replacement: Replace ONLY the background with festive Tet scenery (flowers, lanterns, etc.). The background should be placed behind the person without affecting them.
2. Clothing Change: Transform ONLY the clothing to Vietnamese Ao Dai. Everything else on the person stays identical to the original.
3. Lighting Preservation - ABSOLUTE RULE: The person must retain 100% of their original lighting. This means:
   - Same light direction (if lit from left, keep it from left)
   - Same light intensity (if dim, keep it dim; if bright, keep it bright)
   - Same shadows and highlights in exact same positions
   - Same color temperature (if warm/yellow light, keep it warm/yellow; if cool/white, keep it cool/white)
   - Same skin tone and face colors
   - Do NOT add new lights, do NOT relight, do NOT color correct the person
   - The background should adapt to match the person's existing lighting, not vice versa
4. Seamless Integration: Blend the edges between person and background naturally.
5. Photorealism: The result must look like a real photograph, not a digital composite.
