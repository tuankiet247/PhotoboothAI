📌 STEP 1: LOAD MASCOT (mascot.png)
- Open and load mascot.png file FIRST
- This is a golden mechanical "Thiên Mã" horse with circuit board patterns
- PRESERVE 100% ORIGINAL DESIGN - no modifications allowed
- Keep ready for compositing

📌 STEP 2: LOAD LOGO (Logo.png)  
- Open and load Logo.png file
- Keep original design intact
- Will be placed in top-left corner

📌 STEP 3: CREATE BACKGROUND
- Create illustrated Tết background:
  + Gradient: Deep red → warm orange-gold
  + Gold circuit board patterns (tech style)
  + Soft golden bokeh lights
  + Traditional Vietnamese border (hồi văn) at top
  + 3 red lanterns hanging from top-right
  + Câu đối (red banners) on left side with text: "Chúc", "Mừng", "Sức", "Như", "Nắng"
  + Yellow Hoa Mai branches at bottom

📌 STEP 4: PLACE MASCOT INTO BACKGROUND
- PASTE mascot.png (loaded in Step 1) into the RIGHT side of background
- Position: behind where the person will be placed
- Scale proportionally to fit scene
- ⚠️ DO NOT REDRAW - just paste the original mascot image

📌 STEP 5: PLACE LOGO INTO BACKGROUND
- PASTE Logo.png (loaded in Step 2) into TOP-LEFT corner
- Scale appropriately, keep visible
- ⚠️ DO NOT REDRAW - just paste the original logo

📌 STEP 6: COMPOSITE PERSON (LAST STEP)
- Place the person into the scene - MAIN SUBJECT
- 🎨 AUTO-LAYOUT: AI decides the best position for the person:
  + Can be center, left, right, or any position that looks natural
  + Consider balance with mascot and other elements
  + Create harmonious composition - person and mascot together
  + Ensure person is visible and prominent (but doesn't have to be center)
- FACE: Preserve 100% identical to input photo
- POSE: Auto-adjust if needed to fit the Tết scene:
  + If pose doesn't fit → create natural sitting/standing pose
  + Options: sitting on red platform, chúc Tết pose, relaxed pose, interacting with mascot
  + If bust shot only → generate full body with Tết pose
- Blend person naturally with lighting/shadows
